# VIP

VIP (full name ExP/ViP) is 
my custom editor derived 
from [nex/nvi 1.80](https://repo.or.cz/nvi.git). 

There can be many interpretations of ExP/ViP name, none are official but my favourite one is "Ex Perfected / Vi Perfected" or "Ex by Pyzozord / Vi by Pyzozord" (Pyzozord was my nickname at school). Some other that come to mind are "Experienced" or "Very Important Program", in the end it doesn't matter.

Vip is a vi-like modal editor aiming at editing efficiency and execution perfomance and tries to follow [suckless philosopy](https://suckless.org/philosophy/).
